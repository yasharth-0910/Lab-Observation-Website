<h1>Lab-Observation-Website</h1>

<p>The following website is made by me to solve a big issue of our University student, because we are just too much lazy, and that is a website in which you just enter your lab observation's and you get everything from results too error and what not even graph which u can take print out of</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Just click on the experiment you want to do and enter the observation's and you will get everything</p>

<h2>Experiments we cover</h2>
<br>

<ul>
    <li>Experiment 1: To Determine Band gap in a semiconductor using a PN junction diode</li>
    <li>Experiment 2: To determine planck's constant using LED of known wavelength</li>
    <li>Experiment 3: To meansure Numerical Aperture of an Optical Fiber</li>
    <li>Experiment 4: To study Photovoltaic cell and hence verify Inverse sqaure law</li>
</ul>
